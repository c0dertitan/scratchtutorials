## Getting started
lets grab a "when green flag clicked" block, this will start the script when the green flag is clicked
then a new variable, lets call it... "number?" and grab "a pick rand 10 to 0" block
lets set the "1" to a "5" and the "10" to "0"

## Green flag
click the green flag and the variable changes number.

## Tutorials

#1: Requested by StellaRedGirl:

Let's click create!

so lets grab a "when green flag clicked" block
then lets grab a "change [color] effect by (25) " block
then a wait(1) block
lets change the "1" to a "0.01"
and lets put it in a loop.


That's it! your cat should be changing color like a rainbow!
